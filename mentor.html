      <h1>Well about my mentor, my mentor is: MOSH HANEDANI</h1>
      <p>
        Mosh (Moshfegh) Hamedani is a passionate and pragmatic software engineer
        specializing in web application development with ASP.NET MVC, Web API,
        Entity Framework, Angular, Backbone, HTML5, and CSS. He started
        programming at the age of seven on a Commodore 64 and fell in love with
        it. His dream at the time was to become a software engineer so he could
        create a tennis game for himself in 3D! So this inspired him to pursue
        programming both academically and professionally. He has a Bachelor of
        Science in Software Engineering and a Master of Science in Network
        Systems. Whilst he never learned how to create a game, he has over 15
        years professional experience developing web applications. Since he
        started teaching online 3 years ago, he have taught over 200,000
        students in 192 countries and His YouTube channel has been watched 5.7
        million times. Outside the software world, he enjoys photography,
        playing jazz piano, swimming, and latin dancing. Mosh is based in
        Melbourne, Australia.
